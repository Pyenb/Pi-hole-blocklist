This is the blocklist I use with my Pi-hole. It's compiled out of the individual lists I use, but in a single file. **Updated daily.**

It may not be perfect for everyone, but it's a good starting point. It mostly contains ads, telemetry and other questionable websites.

The list currently contains around *2.6 million* unique domains.

The blocklist generator already cleans up a lot of the data. Still, after each update, the list is checked for domain validity and the results are displayed in the badges above.

## Usage

To use this list, simply add the following URL to your Pi-hole:

```text

```
